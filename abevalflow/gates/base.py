"""Base schemas for gate results.

Gates are evaluation checkpoints that produce standardized results.
Three types exist:
- Engine gates: evaluation engines (Harbor, ASE, A2A, MCPChecker)
- Security gates: security scanners (Cisco, Snyk)
- Quality gates: quality reviewers (LLM review)

Each gate produces a GateResult with a normalized score and pass/fail status.
